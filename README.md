# Pixelhop Vue 3 Starter Project

This is a starter project that is used a base for loads of [Pixelhop](https://pixelhop.io) front-end tutorials! 

This project contains the following pre-installed and configured to help you get up and running with our tutorials quicker so you can get on with the fun stuff!

- Vite - Vite will provide us with front-end tooling.
- PNPM - PNPM has fast become our favourite package manager. Its just like NPM but faster!
- Vue 3 - We are spoilt for choice these days but Vue is still our fave frontend framework.
- TailwindCSS - The Marmitte of CSS frameworks! We love it and find it helps keep our projects consistant and allows us to be super productive.
- Eslint + Prettier - We want to avoid silly mistakes in our code and keep it nicely formatted.
- Vue router - There's very few projects that don't need some kind of routing so we may as well set this up by defualt.
